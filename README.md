## XBOX, RECORD THAT

I made this program as a joke for me and my friends, it basically waits until you say "XBOX, record that" and then simulates pressing alt-F10 with pyautogui to trigger nVidia Shadowplay.

DEPENDENCIES: 

https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/

Only works on Windows for now, as Shadowplay is only available on Windows(sorry, Stallman).
